## Description

I have created an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. Such criteria include their preference to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers or special characters within a chosen length for their password.

## Installation
 This dynamic and responsive app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

## Usage

Kindly press the 'generate password' button and follow the prompts to make  your preferences.
